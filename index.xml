      <description>Some software is very lovable (see zed_is_good_software.md). For the past couple of months, duckdb was one such software I held in high praise. But a single hair-ripping-ly frustrating day later after debugging certain issues1, I have a more nuanced opinion about duckdb.
This scenario brings to mind a certain favourite quote There are unkown unkowns and this great article . In this context, I wrangled with two issues
Duckdb does not support query timeout: This seems so crazy to me.</description>

      <description>Poking around in the ~/.claude folder and looking at the files that claude code is saving to the local machine.
➜ .claude pwd /Users/saahityae/.claude ➜ .claude ls config projects statsig local shell-snapshots todos There&amp;rsquo;s
config -&amp;gt; holds the config related file (eg. which tools are allowed, mcps configured, etc) local -&amp;gt; the actual node CLI app. shell-snapshots -&amp;gt; ? statsig -&amp;gt; something related to https://statsig.com/ . I&amp;rsquo;m guessing its used for feature gating, A/B testing, product analytics etc (basically some statsig functionality) todos - Basically a bunch of files with the structured text of TODOs that the claude code uses when you&amp;rsquo;re using it like { &amp;#34;content&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Modify Dockerfile to use UV instead of Poetry&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;status&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;in_progress&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;priority&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;id&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; }, { &amp;#34;content&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Update file copy instructions to handle uv.</description>

      <description>One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the last couple of years working is that folks generally struggle about how to approach troubleshooting issues on their linux boxes. Generally you have obvious signals about what went wrong, like for instance someone mentioning on slack that they are running some software with new config. Some times you need to gather signals with certain linux tools. This post describes certain tools (htop (mostly), df, du, journalctl) I use at a high level to do basic troubleshooting.</description>

      <title>28 Years Later Movie Review</title>

      <description>I went to see the movie 28 Years Later with no expectations 1(I thought it could be a (trashy ?) zombie horror movie), but found this movie to be suprisingly quality film-making - great story, great acting, good cinematography 2. Roughly, the story is about the protagonist teenager Spikey who is part of a survivor village holed up in an island off mainland (Britain) after a virus turns pretty-much-everyone-else into zombies and his adventures visiting the mainland and his encounters with the zombies.</description>

      <description>The first thing I remember when purchasing this laptop is the delay in shipment. It took like 3 months to finally receive it. I remember calling the customer service after like 2 months asking for an update. They sweet talked to me for an hour (they could have simply said we have supply-chain related delays (which was the standard reason in 2022 for any item that had a chip in it)) and then added a free pair of airpods to my order as an apology for the delay (I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining).</description>

      <description>**These post build upon my thoughts about AI sovereignity following the workshop last week. Its mainly an exploration of two ideas. One is the idea of thinking of soverignity from an societal use-case perspective. The other is an AI diffusion framework. **
Fleshing out the Industry-Academia Idea A good and simple framework for diffusing any new radical idea is &amp;ldquo;Connecting good people to good ideas and good networks&amp;rdquo; (from Takshashila&amp;rsquo;s mission).</description>

      <title>The Scaling Era Book Review</title>

      <description>Dwarkesh&amp;rsquo;s book - &amp;ldquo;The Scaling Era&amp;rdquo; (25th March 2025, Stripe Press) is a delightful oddity. It&amp;rsquo;s uniquely formatted - mostly as snippets of his podcast episodes related to AI categorized across crucial aspects of LLMs like Safety and Scaling. The book is a superb highlight reel of Dwarkesh&amp;rsquo;s podcast, reflecting the excellent quality of his show (superb guest quality, discourse quality, intellectual topics, etc.).
The book excels at discussing the not-strictly technical &amp;amp; under-discussed aspects of LLMs like inference scaling, cluster sizes, and impacts of AGI.</description>

      <description>Recently came across the term ‘enshittification’ (or politically correct version: platform decay) coined by Cory Doctrow: https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/
Are we likely to see similar trends in some of the DPI platforms: Aadhaar, UPI, Digiyatra, etc.? True, the controlling shareholder isn&amp;rsquo;t maximizing for profits but may want to extract a different kind of &amp;lsquo;value&amp;rsquo;.
https://opentakshashila.net/posts/80874543
OP asks an interesting question, are DPIs likely to enshittify in the future ? Your&amp;rsquo;s truly noted down his meandering &amp;amp; biased thoughts below.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve travelled all across the editor-lands from vim to emacs to vscode and then intellij. Now I think I&amp;rsquo;ve settled for Zed (My screen time says I&amp;rsquo;ve used Zed an average of approx. 3 hours over the past work week plus I wrote this post in Zed).
You intuitively get a sense for good software. Over the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of using some good software. Some notable entries in this list are uv (yes, the package manager), Tailscale &amp;amp; Zed.</description>

      <description>So, this post is mainly for detailing my experience using LLMs (hate the broad usage of the term, but heh) over the last week for writing a ton of code. The main tools I&amp;rsquo;ve been using is Zed (absolutely love this code editor who &amp;rsquo;ve done a great job with their AI integrations) plus Aider (CLI tool for pair programing with an LLM), both free tools. Both configurable to use a variety of LLM models based on the API key provided.</description>

      <description>The book &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t Tell Me I Can&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rdquo; is the memoir of an ambitious 14 year old who is homeschooled. It is singular in its genre for being heartfelt and authentic. Reading this book really did feel like a very mature child talking to me. The fact that is 73 pages and written in plain conversational English makes for a great one sitting read.
The book written in first person by Cole Summers (pseudonym) talks about his homeschooling journey which includes starting multiple businesses (I love that he derives inspiration and quotes Buffet and Munger throughout the book).</description>

      <description>Market economics: role of gov offering goods and services
For many essential goods and services, the government becomes a player in the market and offers these goods and services at a controlled price e.g., transport, hospitals etc. Alternative is that the government lets the market provide these goods and services but incentivises them in different ways. How do you assess the two different approaches keeping in mind that any government intervention in general leads to inefficiencies in the market.</description>

      <title>Are Tech Stocks Overvalued ?</title>

      <guid>https://saahityaedams.github.io/posts/are-tech-stocks-overvalued/</guid>
      <description>WIP
My good friend Rishabh argues that US Tech stocks are overvalued (on account of AI hype) and specifically that the &amp;ldquo;Edelweiss US Technology Equity FoF is not a good investment option. He cites this very well written memo from Howard Marks1 that suggests that the Tech Stocks and the S&amp;amp;P 500 shows signs of potential bubble behaviour.
I want to document my thoughts about this and hopefully clarify my thinking (for myself primarily) about why I think some tech stocks are still so attractive to me.</description>

      <description>Rough Notes
Reading the book moneyball felt like a slog (maybe I would be better off watching the movie) and made me feel like the book was overhyped. This could be due to the fact that I knew zilch about baseball before reading the book, and had to do basic wikipedia research while reading the book.
The narrative while strong within a chapter didn&amp;rsquo;t flow through the whole book and the later part of the book felt boring.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;No Presents Please&amp;rsquo; was a fun, light and breezy first read of the year, consisting of 16 short stories set in Mumbai. Following the lives of working and middle-class characters (from the 1990s?), the stories capture people&amp;rsquo;s interactions against the backdrop of their daily work lives, reminded me of a less romantic and primitive version of the Modern Love TV show.
The characters resonated with me deeply, partly due to the nostalgic setting.</description>

There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any specific reason, I just always wanted a cycle from a long time plus I liked running and made the reasonable assumption I would like cycling. I initially made a list of some discounted items on Amazon like Noise Cancellation Headphones or an Air Fryer, but none of them felt right.</description>

I haven&amp;rsquo;t used this laptop since college and decided to use it as an always-on home server and secondary machine in my room plugged into power. There is no concrete plan, but high-level plans include using the 1 Tb hard disk as backup and media store (still researching the best way), self hosting some software, and play around with serving tiny LLM models from it.</description>

      <description>People interact with Claude in 2 ways, end users interact with it via the application (chat interface) and developers build AI applications via the API. These two modes of interaction are priced wildly differently.
Although the application is free, it quickly imposes message limits, and you have to wait for a few hours before your message limit resets. You can upgrade to Claude pro, which is a subscription at $20 per month and gets you 5x more usage.</description>

I have a 5+ yr old kindle paperwhite and it is easily the most well built techy thing I own. It is solid in your hands, and even though it&amp;rsquo;s been dropped countless times, everything seems to work perfectly. It always amazed me that I can pick it up after a month and see that the battery percentage has barely shifted.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack just from saying &amp;lsquo;Indira-nagar&amp;rsquo; versus &amp;lsquo;Subramanya-pura&amp;rsquo;— one gives off a cool-and-hip vibe, while the other feels more like traditional Indian family vibe. I rented a room in the first for the past year to be closer to work, while the latter has been my home (technically my parents&amp;rsquo;) for more than 10 years through school and college before that.
Indiranagar seems like an unusual island isolated from the rest of India - in demeanor and culturally.</description>

The first time I encountered this place was in February 2020. I was training for a half marathon (I am older and tireder now) and set off early in the morning for a slow long run. Feeling adventurous, I ran further than usual.</description>

Starting off with the location. Kerala, what a beauty. The center is basically a plot of tropical rainforest with a few one-story buildings and the main Dhamma center connected by a path. Plus, there are two ponds. Behind the property, there’s a panoramic view of flooded green paddy fields with groves of trees behind them.</description>

      <description>Crossing Bridges(2013) is an unusual movie. Unlike a typical Bollywood movie, it does not have drama, nor is it like the recent Biopicy style movies that show the protagonist overcoming an obstacle, yet the movie was engrossing and my connection with the protagonist so strong that I did not pick up my phone more than twice while watching it.
– SPOILERS AHEAD –
The movie starts by showing a man called Tashi who has returned to his village in Arunachal Pradesh from Mumbai after being laid off.</description>

      <description>Problem For debugging drupal 7 code, there is no packaged shell like django or ROR and we must start a normal PHP interactive shell and then initialize and bootstrap the DRUPAL installation in the shell. This involves searching and copying the 4 lines of drupal initialization and bootstrapping code from the project and pasting it in the PHP shell before doing any Drupal debugging work.
Solution PHP CLI has an settings option auto_prepend_file which can be used to run some initialization code before running the PHP interactive shell with php -a.</description>

      <description>https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_group-concat
In another case of the being burned due to not looking at the documentation properly and blindly copying a query,the root cause of a field issue turned out to be MySQL function GROUP_CONCATE truncating the result of the query to 1024 by default unless group_concat_max_len is set explicitly. Plus depending on the way of processing this query results in your program, it is unlikely to figure out the results were ever truncated.</description>

      <description>Recently saw someone looking at the history of their all the cut-copy text when presenting their screen in a call. One day later after installing https://maccy.app/, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how the heck did I not know something like this(clipboard managers) ever existed before. Psst&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve worked completely remote after completing college.
Very useful for navigating large legacy codebases with bad editor support and the only way to navigate between functions is copying the function name and finding it Pasting commands to run in the terminal shell of a remote servers that you forgot and had run in another remote server.</description>

      <description>Setting up proper logging today prevents the big headache tommorow
Components syslog - inbuilt drupal module to log drupal errors(no particular reason for choosing this module, can use any appropriate module that logs to file or write a module that implements hook_watchdog) logrotate - to archive the old logs to help classify by data and save space. Steps We enable syslog in the modules in drupal and save with the default config add a file in /etc/rsyslog.</description>

      <description>In college we were taught SOLID and GRASP principles which was more heuristics than principles1 that was supposed to make our code better. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know whether applying them helps as I never could remember it and I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about applying it when I was writing code. But one thing that did stay with me from college that was taught and repeated dozens of times by a great professor was the idea of interface and implementation, which was beautifully taught in C++ with the interface being written in the header file and the implementation being written in the library source file.</description>

      <description>Notes taken while listening to Building Endurance the Right Way
Aspects to Endurance - Cardio &amp;amp; Muscular How to develop cardio Steady state exercise - run at particular speed not too fast Cause: Heart stretches when you increase heart rate upto a certain point which increases stroke volume(means a bigger heart) Running at increased heart rate (90% +), heart is twitching and not effective Run at pace where you can have a sustained conversation Interval Training Based on Inertia Run at 80-90% and then start jogging or walking, heart is still beating hard, extra volume of blood is moving which stretches the heart Interval found usefull after period of steady state training Easy to go wrong Walk till you can talk How to Develop Muscular Need/Develop mitochondria in muscle cells Easy to do in slow fibers and harder to do in fast fibers Make muscle oxidative, enduring not polluting 3 main energy systems creatine phosphate</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I ran a 4k in the night at 11:30 PM around my apartment after a late night software release. People talk about starting your day fresh after a run inconveniently missing out the part about waking up early in the morning, and hustling after the run to get to work on time. In contrast when you run at night, you really don&amp;#39;t have anything to get back to except your comfy bed and when you do get back you obviously will sleep like a log cause you are exhausted after running.</description>

      <description>Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I only remember very specific parts of the race. The beginning part(5-6 kms) of the race involved a lot of shuffling and moving around slow runners.
The course through Cubbon park had a chilly weather and the air was very fresh. I remember while running through Cubbon park at a later part of the race I saw this one park filled with tons of dogs running around playfully and some even cheering for me :)</description>
