      <description>Just writing up my experience1 attending a 10-day Vipassana course from the 15th to the 25th of July at Dhamma Ketana in Chengannur.
Starting off with the location. Kerala, what a beauty. The center is basically a plot of tropical rainforest with a few one-story buildings and the main Dhamma center connected by a path. Plus, there are two ponds. Behind the property, thereâ€™s a panoramic view of flooded green paddy fields with groves of trees behind them.</description>
