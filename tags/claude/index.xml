      <description>So, this post is mainly for detailing my experience using LLMs (hate the broad usage of the term, but heh) over the last week for writing a ton of code. The main tools I&amp;rsquo;ve been using is Zed (absolutely love this code editor who &amp;rsquo;ve done a great job with their AI integrations) plus Aider (CLI tool for pair programing with an LLM), both free tools. Both configurable to use a variety of LLM models based on the API key provided.</description>

      <title>Claude Pricing (Application vs API)</title>

      <description>People interact with Claude in 2 ways, end users interact with it via the application (chat interface) and developers build AI applications via the API. These two modes of interaction are priced wildly differently.
Although the application is free, it quickly imposes message limits, and you have to wait for a few hours before your message limit resets. You can upgrade to Claude pro, which is a subscription at $20 per month and gets you 5x more usage.</description>
