      <description>Late at night a week ago, Feeling drowsy, I decided to treat myself to a used cycle for Diwali. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t any specific reason, I just always wanted a cycle from a long time plus I liked running and made the reasonable assumption I would like cycling. I initially made a list of some discounted items on Amazon like Noise Cancellation Headphones or an Air Fryer, but none of them felt right.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack just from saying &amp;lsquo;Indira-nagar&amp;rsquo; versus &amp;lsquo;Subramanya-pura&amp;rsquo;â€” one gives off a cool-and-hip vibe, while the other feels more like traditional Indian family vibe. I rented a room in the first for the past year to be closer to work, while the latter has been my home (technically my parents&amp;rsquo;) for more than 10 years through school and college before that.
Indiranagar seems like an unusual island isolated from the rest of India - in demeanor and culturally.</description>
