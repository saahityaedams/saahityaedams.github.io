      <title>Are Tech Stocks Overvalued ?</title>

      <description>My good friend Rishabh argues that US Tech stocks are overvalued (on account of AI hype) and specifically that the &amp;ldquo;Edelweiss US Technology Equity FoF is not a good investment option. He cites this very well written memo from Howard Marks1 that suggests that the Tech Stocks and the S&amp;amp;P 500 shows signs of potential bubble behaviour.
I want to document my thoughts about this on paper and hopefully clarify my thinking (for myself primarily) about why I think some tech stocks are still so attractive to me.</description>

      <title>Moneyball Review</title>

      <description>Rough Notes
Reading the book moneyball felt like a slog (maybe I would be better off watching the movie) and made me feel like the book was overhyped. This could be due to the fact that I knew zilch about baseball before reading the book, and had to do basic wikipedia research while reading the book.
The narrative while strong within a chapter didn&amp;rsquo;t flow through the whole book and the later part of the book felt boring.</description>

      <title>No Presents Please Review</title>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;No Presents Please&amp;rsquo; was a fun, light and breezy first read of the year, consisting of 16 short stories set in Mumbai. Following the lives of working and middle-class characters (from the 1990s?), the stories capture people&amp;rsquo;s interactions against the backdrop of their daily work lives, reminded me of a less romantic and primitive version of the Modern Love TV show.
The characters resonated with me deeply, partly due to the nostalgic setting.</description>

      <title>Crossing Bridges(2013) Review</title>
      <link>https://saahityaedams.github.io/posts/crossing-bridges/</link>

      <description>Crossing Bridges(2013) is an unusual movie. Unlike a typical Bollywood movie, it does not have drama, nor is it like the recent Biopicy style movies that show the protagonist overcoming an obstacle, yet the movie was engrossing and my connection with the protagonist so strong that I did not pick up my phone more than twice while watching it.
– SPOILERS AHEAD –
The movie starts by showing a man called Tashi who has returned to his village in Arunachal Pradesh from Mumbai after being laid off.</description>
