      <description>&amp;lsquo;No Presents Please&amp;rsquo; was a fun, light and breezy first read of the year, consisting of 16 short stories set in Mumbai. Following the lives of working and middle-class characters (from the 1990s?), the stories capture people&amp;rsquo;s interactions against the backdrop of their daily work lives, reminded me of a less romantic and primitive version of the Modern Love TV show.
The characters resonated with me deeply, partly due to the nostalgic setting.</description>

      <title>Crossing Bridges(2013) Review</title>

      <description>Crossing Bridges(2013) is an unusual movie. Unlike a typical Bollywood movie, it does not have drama, nor is it like the recent Biopicy style movies that show the protagonist overcoming an obstacle, yet the movie was engrossing and my connection with the protagonist so strong that I did not pick up my phone more than twice while watching it.
– SPOILERS AHEAD –
The movie starts by showing a man called Tashi who has returned to his village in Arunachal Pradesh from Mumbai after being laid off.</description>
