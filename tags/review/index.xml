      <description>Crossing Bridges(2013) is an unusual movie. Unlike a typical Bollywood movie, it does not have drama, nor is it like the recent Biopicy style movies that show the protagonist overcoming an obstacle, yet the movie was engrossing and my connection with the protagonist so strong that I did not pick up my phone more than twice while watching it.
– SPOILERS AHEAD –
The movie starts by showing a man called Tashi who has returned to his village in Arunachal Pradesh from Mumbai after being laid off.</description>
