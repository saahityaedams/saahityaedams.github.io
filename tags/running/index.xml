      <description>  Notes taken while listening to Building Endurance the Right Way Aspects to Endurance - Cardio &amp;amp; Muscular  How to develop cardio  Steady state exercise - run at particular speed not too fast     Cause: Heart stretches when you increase heart rate upto a certain point which increases stroke volume(means a bigger heart)    Running at increased heart rate (90% +), heart is twitching and not effective    Run at pace where you can have a sustained conversation   Interval Training     Based on Inertia    Run at 80-90% and then start jogging or walking, heart is still beating hard, extra volume of blood is moving which stretches the heart    Interval found usefull after period of steady state training    Easy to go wrong    Walk till you can talk   How to Develop Muscular  Need/Develop mitochondria in muscle cells     Easy to do in slow fibers and harder to do in fast fibers    Make muscle oxidative, enduring not polluting   3 main energy systems     creatine phosphate    clean burning and for short durations      aerobic    less powerfull    longer lasting      glyocalytic    inbetween     Train in a way to produce less acid  For slow fibers     moving right below anerobic threshold    Anaerobic is intensity where acid is accumulating at rate where the body can dispose at the same rate    above anaerobic threshold when you are failing the talk test   For fast fibers     N/A :) because I had stopped watching the video by this point of time   </description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I ran a 4k in the night at 11:30 PM around my apartment after a late night software release. People talk about starting your day fresh after a run inconveniently missing out the part about waking up early in the morning, and hustling after the run to get to work on time. In contrast when you run at night, you really don&amp;#39;t have anything to get back to except your comfy bed and when you do get back you obviously will sleep like a log cause you are exhausted after running.</description>

      <description>Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I only remember very specific parts of the race. The beginning part(5-6 kms) of the race involved a lot of shuffling and moving around slow runners.
The course through Cubbon park had a chilly weather and the air was very fresh. I remember while running through Cubbon park at a later part of the race I saw this one park filled with tons of dogs running around playfully and some even cheering for me :)</description>
