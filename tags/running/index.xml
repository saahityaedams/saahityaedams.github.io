      <title>Driving 30 min to run in the woods</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People look at me strangely when I mention that I drive like 30 mins one way just to jog awkwardly on a stretch of road in the middle-of-nowhere on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first time I encountered this place was in February 2020. I was training for a half marathon (I am older and tireder now) and set off early in the morning for a slow long run. Feeling adventurous, I ran further than usual. As I progressed, Bangalore&amp;rsquo;s outskirts changed from empty BDA plots and occasional houses to deserted access roads partially reclaimed by plants. This gave way to a stretch of empty highway, which then became a small road winding through the woods leading to a lake. I returned home after noon, feeling like an explorer who had reached some foreign land.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time ever, I ran a 4k in the night at 11:30 PM around my apartment after a late night software release.&#xA;People talk about starting your day fresh after a run inconveniently missing out the part about waking up early in the morning, and hustling after the run to get to work on time.&#xA;In contrast when you run at night, you really don&amp;#39;t have anything to get back to except your comfy bed and when you do get back you obviously will sleep like a log cause you are exhausted after running.&#xA;There are still some parts I don&amp;#39;t like about running at night, like being constrained to the apartment hence doing the same loop multiple times plus you can&amp;#39;t exactly look at where you step.&#xA;I am definitely going on night runs much more often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I only remember very specific parts of the race. The beginning part(5-6 kms) of the race involved a lot of shuffling and moving around slow runners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The course through Cubbon park had a chilly weather and the air was very fresh. I remember while running through Cubbon park at a later part of the race I saw this one park filled with tons of dogs running around playfully and some even cheering for me :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
