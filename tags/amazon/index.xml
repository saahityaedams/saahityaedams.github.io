      <description>I recently read a Wall Street Journal1 article about kindles having a resurgence amongst young readers, which resonated with me since I love my kindle too.
I have a 5+ yr old kindle paperwhite and it is easily the most well built techy thing I own. It is solid in your hands, and even though it&amp;rsquo;s been dropped countless times, everything seems to work perfectly. It always amazed me that I can pick it up after a month and see that the battery percentage has barely shifted.</description>
