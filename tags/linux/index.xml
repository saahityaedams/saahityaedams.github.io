      <description>&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed over the last couple of years working is that folks generally struggle about how to approach troubleshooting issues on their linux boxes. Generally you have obvious signals about what went wrong, like for instance someone mentioning on slack that they are running some software with new config. Some times you need to gather signals with certain linux tools. This post describes certain tools (htop (mostly), df, du, journalctl) I use at a high level to do basic troubleshooting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a slightly old gaming laptop (i5, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050) which ran Ubuntu + windows. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used this laptop since college and decided to use it as an always-on home server and secondary machine in my room plugged into power. There is no concrete plan, but high-level plans include using the 1 Tb hard disk as backup and media store (still researching the best way), self hosting some software, and play around with serving tiny LLM models from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
