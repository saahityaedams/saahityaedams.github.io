      <description>Clint Eastwood has been an absolute inspiration and hero to me (and for the longest time). When I try explaining my reasoning to suprised people, i&#39;m never able to frame it properly. Do I like his acting in spaghetti westerns ? Yes I do, but that&#39;s not exactly it. Do I like his elegant narrative directorials ? I love them, but that&#39;s not it too. Both of these reasons are simplistic and don&#39;t hit the nail exactly about why I revere Mr Clint Eastwood.</description>
