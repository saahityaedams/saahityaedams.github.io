      <description>&lt;!--&#xA;this was my first sem&#xA;i took hpc and llm inference systems&#xA;hpc&#xA;    - good labs&#xA;    - good lectures&#xA;    - helpful TAs&#xA;&#xA;LLM infernece systems&#xA;    - &#xA;unable to attend office hours because it was in the early morning&#xA;till the midterm things were going good&#xA;&#xA;i didn&#39;t finish strong, especially in hpc. I majorly screwed up the finals, especially because work was hectic, plus some other family priorities came up&#xA;i knew it was hard, but still struggled because i was unable to prioritize finals study till the last minute&#xA;--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;blah blah&lt;/p&gt;</description>
