      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently saw someone looking at the history of their all the cut-copy text  when presenting their screen in a call. One day later after installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://maccy.app/&#34;&gt;https://maccy.app/&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how the heck did I not know something like this(clipboard managers) ever existed before. Psst&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve worked completely remote after completing college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Very useful for navigating large legacy codebases with bad editor support and the only way to navigate between functions is copying the function name and finding it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pasting commands to run in the terminal shell of a remote servers that you forgot and had run in another remote server.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You copied something and forgot about it, later in the day you need it and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to go through your tabs, documents, code, etc. It probably is there in the history of the clipboard manager.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
