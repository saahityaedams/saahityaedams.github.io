      <description>I have a definitely-not-well-thought-out theory about ESG(Environmental, Social and Goverance) stocks.

In 10th grade I remember our English teacher asking whether it is moral for a person to own a luxury car since it is so polluting and one of my classmates made the point that people buy luxury cars more of a status symbol than for its characteristics.</description>
