      <description>In college we were taught SOLID and GRASP principles which was more heuristics than principles1 that was supposed to make our code better. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know whether applying them helps as I never could remember it and I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about applying it when I was writing code. But one thing that did stay with me from college that was taught and repeated dozens of times by a great professor was the idea of interface and implementation, which was beautifully taught in C++ with the interface being written in the header file and the implementation being written in the library source file.</description>
