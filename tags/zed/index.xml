      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve travelled all across the editor-lands from vim to emacs to vscode and then intellij. Now I think I&amp;rsquo;ve settled for Zed (My screen time says I&amp;rsquo;ve used Zed an average of approx. 3 hours over the past work week plus I wrote this post in Zed).
You intuitively get a sense for good software. Over the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve had the pleasure of using some good software. Some notable entries in this list are uv (yes, the package manager), Tailscale &amp;amp; Zed.</description>

      <title>My LLM usage pattern</title>

      <description>So, this post is mainly for detailing my experience using LLMs (hate the broad usage of the term, but heh) over the last week for writing a ton of code. The main tools I&amp;rsquo;ve been using is Zed (absolutely love this code editor who &amp;rsquo;ve done a great job with their AI integrations) plus Aider (CLI tool for pair programing with an LLM), both free tools. Both configurable to use a variety of LLM models based on the API key provided.</description>
