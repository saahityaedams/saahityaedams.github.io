      <description>I recently read a Wall Street Journal1 article about kindles having a resurgence amongst young readers, which resonated with me since I love my kindle too.
I have a 5+ yr old kindle paperwhite and it is easily the most well built techy thing I own. It is solid in your hands, and even though it&amp;rsquo;s been dropped countless times, everything seems to work perfectly. It always amazed me that I can pick it up after a month and see that the battery percentage has barely shifted.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack just from saying &amp;lsquo;Indira-nagar&amp;rsquo; versus &amp;lsquo;Subramanya-pura&amp;rsquo;â€” one gives off a cool-and-hip vibe, while the other feels more like traditional Indian family vibe. I rented a room in the first for the past year to be closer to work, while the latter has been my home (technically my parents&amp;rsquo;) for more than 10 years through school and college before that.
Indiranagar seems like an unusual island isolated from the rest of India - in demeanor and culturally.</description>
