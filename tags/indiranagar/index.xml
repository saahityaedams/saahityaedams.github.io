      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack just from saying &amp;lsquo;Indira-nagar&amp;rsquo; versus &amp;lsquo;Subramanya-pura&amp;rsquo;— one gives off a cool-and-hip vibe, while the other feels more like traditional Indian family vibe. I rented a room in the first for the past year to be closer to work, while the latter has been my home (technically my parents&amp;rsquo;) for more than 10 years through school and college before that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Indiranagar seems like an unusual island isolated from the rest of India - in demeanor and culturally. I remember reading that it was originally an old Bangalore suburb where army officers lived; now it&amp;rsquo;s the happening and desired place in Bangalore. Most streets are pretty clean, lined with large trees( which form a canopy above you). There are no high-rises to be seen anywhere. It&amp;rsquo;s a melting pot &amp;ldquo;posh&amp;rdquo; area with well-to-do people from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
