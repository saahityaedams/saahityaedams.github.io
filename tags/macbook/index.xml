      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first thing I remember when purchasing this laptop is the delay in shipment. It took like 3 months to finally receive it. I remember calling the customer service after like 2 months asking for an update. They sweet talked to me for an hour (they could have simply said we have supply-chain related delays (which was the standard reason in 2022 for any item that had a chip in it)) and then added a free pair of airpods to my order as an apology for the delay (I&amp;rsquo;m not complaining). I&amp;rsquo;ve now had my Macbook M1 Air for 3 years and have some thoughts on it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
