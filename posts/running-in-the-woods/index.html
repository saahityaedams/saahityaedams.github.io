				<p>People look at me strangely when I mention that I drive like 30 mins one way just to jog awkwardly on a stretch of road in the middle-of-nowhere on weekends.</p>
<p>The first time I encountered this place was in February 2020. I was training for a half marathon (I am older and tireder now) and set off early in the morning for a slow long run. Feeling adventurous, I ran further than usual. As I progressed, Bangalore&rsquo;s outskirts changed from empty BDA plots and occasional houses to deserted access roads partially reclaimed by plants. This gave way to a stretch of empty highway, which then became a small road winding through the woods leading to a lake. I returned home after noon, feeling like an explorer who had reached some foreign land.</p>
<p>Running here is sensual experience. Forgotten nature with almost no people and vehicles. The scenery is dominated by shades of green and browns. A silence that you donâ€™t get in cities interrupted with the occasional bird chirp and peacock squawk. The nip of the cold morning air and foresty scent lingers in the air. Running through the single-laned, tree-lined road with its rolling curves is a unique experience. The large lake with a view at the end of the route is not even the most impressive part of the run.</p>
<p>Driving here to run feels like an essential ritual which I&rsquo;m drawn to on early weekend mornings. Running here feels like a mini vacation from hustling-bustling Bangalore and a chance to reset my mind for the start of a brand new week. The exercise is not even that important, its more like an excuse.</p>
