				<!-- Points:
- 1
  - went in with zero idea of what to expect except that it would be a (likely trashy) zombie horror (I didn't know this movie had some prequels, never the less its stands solid alone)
  - suprisingly quality film-making,ie. good story, good cinematography
    - weird cinematography (with unnecceary night vision footage of zombies, and shots of vintage army clips overlaced with a chantish-poem I now as Boots by Kipling) at times but still
  - story about survivor village holed up off an island of British mainland after a virus infects peoples and turns them into zombies. protoganist comes off age and goes to mainland with Dad as a rite of passage and then returns. Then he decides to go alone with his terminally ill Mum to find a supposedly kooky doctor on the mainland
  - always relate to stories of protoganist trying to help their families in dystopia genre potrayed realistically aka Apocalypto genre aka Train to Busan genre

- 2
  - short side rant about the movie-watching experience degrading further and further for viewers. You now have credit card salesman and save-the-children-type donation people approaching you in the the theatre lounge. This is apart from the 500 rupee popcorn plus the crappy 20 minutes long ads at the start of the movie.
  - Story
    - The part before intermission is protoganist's Spikey coming-of-age adventure in the mainland with Dad. He kills a zombie and escape a lot more before coming back to the island.
    - The second part is silghtly more logic-bendish and interesting. Spikey causes a diversion on the survivor's island and runs of with obviously terminally-ill mother to meet some doctor to help her. On the way they are chased by zombies, meet Eeerik (aka Nordic super soldier), deliver a normal baby from a zombie mother (how ?). Finally they meet the doctor who tells the mother she has terminal cancer ( what ?), then euthanizes her (what ?). Spikey then returns to the island, drops of the baby and goes back to the Mainland (why ?) where's chased by zombies again and the movie ends in suspense by him being saved by a fashionable (track-suit wearing) british gang.
    - Loved Erik's character (Soldier stuck on the Island) - its just so Swedish-coded dialogue delivery. His short stay before having his head ripped out by an Alpha (Super Zombie) truely ligthened the mood in the theatre.

  - I think this movie (and the movies in the dystopian genre I described) works for me because its a very-well-told movie with a proper hero character arc. Spikey is real teenager, the world he is part of feels like a very real system (in the higher-level sense that its barbaric without civilization) unlike the crappy superhero movies where the hero is definitely not real (in terms of their actions, behaviour, intentions) and the world surrounding him/her either. -->
<p>I went to see the movie 28 Years Later with no expectations <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>(I thought it could be a (trashy ?) zombie horror movie), but found this movie to be suprisingly quality film-making - great story, great acting, good cinematography <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Roughly, the story is about the protagonist teenager Spikey who is part of a survivor village holed up in an island off mainland (Britain) after a virus turns pretty-much-everyone-else into zombies and his adventures visiting the mainland and his encounters with the zombies. I really liked the movie and I think it ranks highly amongst other greats in the genre like Apocalypto and Train to Busan.</p>
<p>The movie splits very well into 2 parts along the intermission. The first-part is Spikey&rsquo;s fake coming-of-age where he visits the mainland with Dad, kills a ceremonious fat zombie, gets chased down by other zombies before getting back to the island safely. The second-part is Spikey&rsquo;s real coming-of-age. It&rsquo;s slightly more logic-bending and interesting, he wants to treat his progressively sicker mother, so he causes a diversion, takes her and comes to the mainland in search of a doctor who is supposedly kooky, lives-alone and spends his time burning the dead. On the way, they are chased by zombies -&gt; meet Erik (aka Nordic super soldier) -&gt; deliver a normal baby from a zombie mother. Finally when they meet the doctor in his lair of skulls and bones, he tells the mother she has terminal cancer, then euthanizes her and cremates her. Spikey then returns to the island, drops-off the new-born baby and goes back to the Mainland <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> where he&rsquo;s chased by zombies again. The movie ends in suspense with Spikey being rescued (adopted ?) by a fashionable (track-suit wearing) british gang.</p>
<p>Erik&rsquo;s character in the second-part of the movie was a great addition. Absolutely hilarious Swedish-coded dialogue delivery (explanation of online-delivery to a survivor, proving a point to his delivery driver friend by signing up for the navy). His short stay on screen was truly appreciated by the audience (and lightened the mood in the theatre)  before having his head ripped out by an Alpha (Super Zombie).</p>
<p>I think this movie works very well in its genre because it&rsquo;s a very well told story with a proper hero-arc for the protagonist and great world-building. Spikey feels like a real teenager, the world he is part of feels like a very real system (in the higher-level sense that its barbarism without civilization). This is unlike trashy superhero movies where the hero does not feel like a person (in terms of their actions, behaviour, intentions) nor does the world around him which doesn&rsquo;t seem coherent.</p>

<p>man the movie-watching experience degrades further and further for movie-goers everytime I&rsquo;m at the movies (not often).
