	*       Professional helpful ih staff
	*	Should plan to do this once a year
	*	Should start running again(fitness level down)
	*	Insignificance compared to the mountains and nature.
	*	Times flies when you are trekking
	*	Trekking shouldn’t be a masochist activity, must be slight cardio
	*	Should I be in the front or the back of the queue of people trekking(advantages vs disadvantages ?)
