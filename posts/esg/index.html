<p>In 10th grade I remember our English teacher asking whether it is moral for a person to own a luxury car since it is so polluting and one of my classmates made the point that people buy luxury cars more of a status symbol than for its characteristics. In the current world where we have a vocal set of consumers who care about how ethical and enironmental friendly the companies they buy from are(Some genuinely interested but most as a pseudo status symbol to show of to their peers).Early Tesla is a great example of this, people paid $112,000 for a Roadster mostly as a green credential and status symbol more than for its particularly overall bad specs. Well the same wealthy consumers also look at the stock market and buy these same stocks. And we know what happens when more people want something in limited quantity, it&#39;s price spikes.</p>

<p>Also ESG stocks tend to be well performing companies by their very nature, because these companies are putting time, money, effort to seem like or actually work towards being green and have a social impact which means they have a sizeable business with a stable business model mostly likely with less competitors. If any of the above conditions were not present, the company would primarily deploy its resources elsewhere that is making money.</p>
