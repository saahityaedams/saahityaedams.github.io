				<p>Crossing Bridges(2013) is an unusual movie. Unlike a typical Bollywood movie, it does not have drama, nor is it like the recent Biopicy style movies that show the protagonist overcoming an obstacle, yet the movie was engrossing and my connection with the protagonist so strong that I did not pick up my phone more than twice while watching it.</p>
<p><em>– SPOILERS AHEAD –</em></p>
<p>The movie starts by showing a man called Tashi who has returned to his village in Arunachal Pradesh from Mumbai after being laid off. Tashi is shown as this guy who has come back to his village after a very long time working in the city as a YASP(yours truly) and hence doesn’t seem to fit in his village. Not that there is a lack of conflict in the movie, but the protagonist&rsquo;s main conflict is so sublime and internal(just like most normal people): his parents want him to settle down in the village to take over the farm, he wants to get a job back in the city and move back as he is bored in the village. There are other non-crucial points in the storyline, him buying a TV as he is bored(Dad is against the idea, but is glued to it after he gets it), his friendly relationship with a fellow replacement teacher Anila<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, etc. Finally, Tashi decides to stay back in the village as a teacher even after getting a job in the city.</p>
<p>The movie&rsquo;s title comes from the symbolism of him not being to cross the bridge without help when he arrives in the village the first time vs being able to cross the bridge by the end of the movie. The symbolism is strong in the movie with another scene where Tashi&rsquo;s fancy sandals drifts away in the stream.</p>
<p><strong>Crossing bridges</strong> is a simple, no-frills movie with great cinematography and beautiful scenaries from Arunachal Pradesh. The actors in the movie play very realistic and normal characters sublimely and the dialogues feel so realistic.The movie centers around a character and topic that is very relatable to a majority of people(ie migrating to another place for a job, relation with your hometown) and is a great watch. It is shares many characteristic with another good movie <strong>Before Sunrise</strong> ie: plot honestly not that important to the movie, movie built on realistic dialogue between the actors, great background.</p>
