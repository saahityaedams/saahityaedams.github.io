				<p>Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I only remember very specific parts of the race. The beginning part(5-6 kms) of the race involved a lot of shuffling and moving around slow runners.</p>
<p>The course through Cubbon park had a chilly weather and the air was very fresh. I remember while running through Cubbon park at a later part of the race I saw this one park filled with tons of dogs running around playfully and some even cheering for me :)</p>
<p>While going through the 10km point - around the U-turn at the Cubbon park road, for the first time I felt that my pace was very hard to keep up and I had to slow down even I had to run the complete race.</p>
<p>The run along MG road was the time I remember becoming consistently inconsistent. I switched between running and walking at least half a dozen times along the MG road.I also felt very uncomfortable running back from the MG road U turn because the sun was up and in my face and it was becoming incredibly warm and sunny.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Cubbon park while coming back, I felt like I hit the wall, I was ahead of both the 2:00 pacers until then and remember trying desperately to run along with them as they ran past me and crossed me with ease.</p>
<p>The last 2-3 km was especially hard for me, and I have no recollection of it except a lot of people were cheering for the runners in general (I remember a hilarious sign &ldquo;DONUT STOP&rdquo; and guys wearing pirate hats).For some reason I could sprint towards the finish line in the stadium after entering the stadium even though I was clearly very exhausted.</p>
<p>Throughout the race, I hydrated myself appropriately, I almost always drank a gulp of water, sometimes electrolyte at every eventh kilometer.</p>
<p>Final rating: 7/10. Great first half marathon.</p>
