				<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to unpack just from saying &lsquo;Indira-nagar&rsquo; versus &lsquo;Subramanya-pura&rsquo;— one gives off a cool-and-hip vibe, while the other feels more like traditional Indian family vibe. I rented a room in the first for the past year to be closer to work, while the latter has been my home (technically my parents&rsquo;) for more than 10 years through school and college before that.</p>
<p>Indiranagar seems like an unusual island isolated from the rest of India - in demeanor and culturally. I remember reading that it was originally an old Bangalore suburb where army officers lived; now it&rsquo;s the happening and desired place in Bangalore. Most streets are pretty clean, lined with large trees( which form a canopy above you). There are no high-rises to be seen anywhere. It&rsquo;s a melting pot &ldquo;posh&rdquo; area with well-to-do people from across the country.</p>
<p>Walking around in the commercial parts of Indiranagar is like staring into an alternative reality with young and out-of-this-world hot and happy people in their 20&rsquo;s who seem to be spend their time in expensive restaurants and coffee shops. Despite this, walking around in Indiranagar is still great fun, there&rsquo;s large footpaths, large tree canopies, parks, picturesque looking residential streets. I always preferred to walk over using my bike to get groceries at MK Retail or get food at Wanleys. Strolling through Defense colony or past a Total Environment building (there’s 2 of them) always brought me joy with me walking 10 kms on somedays. There are some parts that are clearly over-commercialized, but that&rsquo;s kind of convenient sometimes too.</p>
<p>Nineteen metro stops away, Subramanyapura gives off a different vibe from young and urban Indiranagar. It is an area that is still growing. A few years ago, there were hardly any shops or people living nearby, now there seems to be a lot more life in the area (probably due to newly constructed apartments + good metro connectivity). To be fair, there are still some issues - garbage piles in some spots, stray dogs; but the general sense I get is that in a couple of years, it should be like ISRO layout. Residents here are more normal, middle-aged-and-middle-class people more concerned about raising their children and taking care of their families. Most people stick to spending most of their time in their manicured apartments and venture out infrequently. I remember a long time ago, you would be able to stroll into the Turahalli forest and trek up the hill before it was fenced off. The area being on the southern outskirts of the city is great for taking long drives down Kanakapura road or along Kaggalipura road.</p>
