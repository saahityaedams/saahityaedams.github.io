The fact that is 73 pages and written in plain conversational English makes for a great one sitting read.

<p>The book written in first person by Cole Summers (pseudonym) talks about his homeschooling journey which includes starting multiple businesses (I love that he derives inspiration and quotes Buffet and Munger throughout the book). From his first business at 7, breeding and selling rabbits, to then purchasing a 350 acre ranch (for rearing meat goats) at 9 and buying/renovating a house shortly after that.</p>
<p>The main takeaway I got from the book is that kids are capable of so much. Adults really shouldn&rsquo;t be discouraging children from dreaming big. Personally I came away from the book filled with agency and energy.</p>
