People talk about starting your day fresh after a run inconveniently missing out the part about waking up early in the morning, and hustling after the run to get to work on time.
In contrast when you run at night, you really don&#39;t have anything to get back to except your comfy bed and when you do get back you obviously will sleep like a log cause you are exhausted after running.
There are still some parts I don&#39;t like about running at night, like being constrained to the apartment hence doing the same loop multiple times plus you can&#39;t exactly look at where you step.
I am definitely going on night runs much more often.</p>
