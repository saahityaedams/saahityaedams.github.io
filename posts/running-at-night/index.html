In contrast when you run at night, you really don&#39;t have anything to get back to except your bed and when you do get back you obviously will sleep like a log cause you are tired after running. There are still some parts I don&#39;t like about running at night like being contrained to the apartment hence doing the same loop multiple times or not being able to look at where you step. I am definitely going on night runs more often.</p>
