      <description>I have a slightly old gaming laptop (i5, 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050) which ran Ubuntu + windows. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used this laptop since college and decided to use it as an always-on home server and secondary machine in my room plugged into power. There is no concrete plan, but high-level plans include using the 1 Tb hard disk as backup and media store (still researching the best way), self hosting some software, and play around with serving tiny LLM models from it.</description>

      <title>Claude Pricing (Application vs API)</title>
      <link>https://saahityaedams.github.io/posts/claude-pricing/</link>

      <description>People interact with Claude in 2 ways, end users interact with it via the application (chat interface) and developers build AI applications via the API. These two modes of interaction are priced wildly differently.
Although the application is free, it quickly imposes message limits, and you have to wait for a few hours before your message limit resets. You can upgrade to Claude pro, which is a subscription at $20 per month and gets you 5x more usage.</description>

      <description>I recently read a Wall Street Journal1 article about kindles having a resurgence amongst young readers, which resonated with me since I love my kindle too.
I have a 5+ yr old kindle paperwhite and it is easily the most well built techy thing I own. It is solid in your hands, and even though it&amp;rsquo;s been dropped countless times, everything seems to work perfectly. It always amazed me that I can pick it up after a month and see that the battery percentage has barely shifted.</description>

      <title>Indiranagar vs Subramanyapura</title>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack just from saying &amp;lsquo;Indira-nagar&amp;rsquo; versus &amp;lsquo;Subramanya-pura&amp;rsquo;— one gives off a cool-and-hip vibe, while the other feels more like traditional Indian family vibe. I rented a room in the first for the past year to be closer to work, while the latter has been my home (technically my parents&amp;rsquo;) for more than 10 years through school and college before that.
Indiranagar seems like an unusual island isolated from the rest of India - in demeanor and culturally.</description>

      <title>Driving 30 min to run in the woods</title>

      <description>People look at me strangely when I mention that I drive like 30 mins one way just to jog awkwardly on a stretch of road in the middle-of-nowhere on weekends.
The first time I encountered this place was in February 2020. I was training for a half marathon (I am older and tireder now) and set off early in the morning for a slow long run. Feeling adventurous, I ran further than usual.</description>

      <description>Just writing up my experience1 attending a 10-day Vipassana course from the 15th to the 25th of July at Dhamma Ketana in Chengannur.
Starting off with the location. Kerala, what a beauty. The center is basically a plot of tropical rainforest with a few one-story buildings and the main Dhamma center connected by a path. Plus, there are two ponds. Behind the property, there’s a panoramic view of flooded green paddy fields with groves of trees behind them.</description>

      <title>Crossing Bridges(2013) Review</title>

      <description>Crossing Bridges(2013) is an unusual movie. Unlike a typical Bollywood movie, it does not have drama, nor is it like the recent Biopicy style movies that show the protagonist overcoming an obstacle, yet the movie was engrossing and my connection with the protagonist so strong that I did not pick up my phone more than twice while watching it.
– SPOILERS AHEAD –
The movie starts by showing a man called Tashi who has returned to his village in Arunachal Pradesh from Mumbai after being laid off.</description>

      <title>Simple Drupal 7 Shell</title>
      <link>https://saahityaedams.github.io/posts/drupal-shell/</link>

      <guid>https://saahityaedams.github.io/posts/drupal-shell/</guid>
      <description>Problem For debugging drupal 7 code, there is no packaged shell like django or ROR and we must start a normal PHP interactive shell and then initialize and bootstrap the DRUPAL installation in the shell. This involves searching and copying the 4 lines of drupal initialization and bootstrapping code from the project and pasting it in the PHP shell before doing any Drupal debugging work.
Solution PHP CLI has an settings option auto_prepend_file which can be used to run some initialization code before running the PHP interactive shell with php -a.</description>

      <description>https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html#function_group-concat
In another case of the being burned due to not looking at the documentation properly and blindly copying a query,the root cause of a field issue turned out to be MySQL function GROUP_CONCATE truncating the result of the query to 1024 by default unless group_concat_max_len is set explicitly. Plus depending on the way of processing this query results in your program, it is unlikely to figure out the results were ever truncated.</description>

      <description>Recently saw someone looking at the history of their all the cut-copy text when presenting their screen in a call. One day later after installing https://maccy.app/, I&amp;rsquo;m wondering how the heck did I not know something like this(clipboard managers) ever existed before. Psst&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s probably because I&amp;rsquo;ve worked completely remote after completing college.
Very useful for navigating large legacy codebases with bad editor support and the only way to navigate between functions is copying the function name and finding it Pasting commands to run in the terminal shell of a remote servers that you forgot and had run in another remote server.</description>

      <description>Setting up proper logging today prevents the big headache tommorow
Components syslog - inbuilt drupal module to log drupal errors(no particular reason for choosing this module, can use any appropriate module that logs to file or write a module that implements hook_watchdog) logrotate - to archive the old logs to help classify by data and save space. Steps We enable syslog in the modules in drupal and save with the default config add a file in /etc/rsyslog.</description>

      <description>In college we were taught SOLID and GRASP principles which was more heuristics than principles1 that was supposed to make our code better. I honestly don&amp;#39;t know whether applying them helps as I never could remember it and I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t thinking about applying it when I was writing code. But one thing that did stay with me from college that was taught and repeated dozens of times by a great professor was the idea of interface and implementation, which was beautifully taught in C++ with the interface being written in the header file and the implementation being written in the library source file.</description>

      <description>Notes taken while listening to Building Endurance the Right Way
Aspects to Endurance - Cardio &amp;amp; Muscular How to develop cardio Steady state exercise - run at particular speed not too fast Cause: Heart stretches when you increase heart rate upto a certain point which increases stroke volume(means a bigger heart) Running at increased heart rate (90% +), heart is twitching and not effective Run at pace where you can have a sustained conversation Interval Training Based on Inertia Run at 80-90% and then start jogging or walking, heart is still beating hard, extra volume of blood is moving which stretches the heart Interval found usefull after period of steady state training Easy to go wrong Walk till you can talk How to Develop Muscular Need/Develop mitochondria in muscle cells Easy to do in slow fibers and harder to do in fast fibers Make muscle oxidative, enduring not polluting 3 main energy systems creatine phosphate</description>

      <description>For the first time ever, I ran a 4k in the night at 11:30 PM around my apartment after a late night software release. People talk about starting your day fresh after a run inconveniently missing out the part about waking up early in the morning, and hustling after the run to get to work on time. In contrast when you run at night, you really don&amp;#39;t have anything to get back to except your comfy bed and when you do get back you obviously will sleep like a log cause you are exhausted after running.</description>

      <description>Overall my memory of the race is very hazy and I only remember very specific parts of the race. The beginning part(5-6 kms) of the race involved a lot of shuffling and moving around slow runners.
The course through Cubbon park had a chilly weather and the air was very fresh. I remember while running through Cubbon park at a later part of the race I saw this one park filled with tons of dogs running around playfully and some even cheering for me :)</description>
