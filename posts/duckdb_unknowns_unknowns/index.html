<p>This scenario brings to mind a certain favourite quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">There are unkown unkowns</a> and this <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">great article</a> . In this context, I wrangled with two issues</p>
<h3 id="duckdb-does-not-support-query-timeout">Duckdb does not support query timeout:</h3>
<p>This seems so crazy to me. How does someone consider this for a production usecase without a fundamental feature like this. All the workaround for this talk about a multi processing (a mult-thread doesn&rsquo;t work) with a timeout (and consequently move away from in-memory usage to the FS usage of duckdb to avoid penalty of running queries against uncached tables each time).</p>
<p>Again I understand the reasoning for this (now). DuckDB is an single-in-process engine and its just not feasible to implement a timeout. But I wish this was considered before using this in our system.</p>
<h3 id="duckdb-and-aws-support-is-poor">Duckdb and AWS support is poor.</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why, but I saw intermittent issues when in the middle of a long task in ECS, DuckDB would just stop processing queries and throw a 400 auth exception. I&rsquo;m guessing its related to one of these github issues - <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-aws/issues/31">issue A</a>, <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-aws/issues/26">issue B</a>, <a href="https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-aws/issues">&hellip;</a>. But the point is that debugging it was much harder than it should have been. And clearly going by the github issues the AWS support can be better.</p>
<p>Just glad to be over this speed bump. :/</p>
