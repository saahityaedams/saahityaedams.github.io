Clint Eastwood has been an absolute inspiration and hero to me (and for the longest time). When I try explaining my reasoning to suprised people, i'm never able to frame it properly. Do I like his acting in spaghetti westerns ? Yes I do, but that's not exactly it. Do I like his elegant narrative directorials ? I love them, but that's not it too. Both of these reasons are simplistic and don't hit the nail exactly about why I revere Mr Clint Eastwood.
<p>It&rsquo;s something about his personality. A 94 year old man still directing amazing movies <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> !! 20 mostly great movies directed in the last 25 years <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> !! I really do hope I have this kind of energy in my 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s in life, you definitely don&rsquo;t see this in most people. Also how many folks have a long, storied 65-year acting career, from &ldquo;Good, Bad and Ugly&rdquo;(1966) to &ldquo;Million Dollar Baby&rdquo;(2004) to &ldquo;Cry Macho&rdquo;(2021). There&rsquo;s something in his acting, the characters he plays feel human. There&rsquo;s something with his directing too where you go that&rsquo;s definitely a Clint Eastwood movie. For one, the story is solid and the characters drive the script and the movie. Most of his movies deals with flawed heroes dealing with morality in a way that isnt preachy to audience.
