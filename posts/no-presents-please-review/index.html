  <meta itemprop="description" content="‘No Presents Please’ was a fun, light and breezy first read of the year, consisting of 16 short stories set in Mumbai.

				<p>&lsquo;No Presents Please&rsquo; was a fun, light and breezy first read of the year, consisting of 16 short stories set in Mumbai. Following the lives of working and middle-class characters (from the 1990s?), the stories capture people&rsquo;s interactions against the backdrop of their daily work lives, reminded me of a less romantic and primitive version of the Modern Love TV show.</p>
<p>The characters resonated with me deeply, partly due to the nostalgic setting. These are honest people making just enough to get by, living simpler lives while facing universal human challenges. Despite their modest circumstances, their stories touch on fundamental aspects of the human condition.</p>
<p>Reading this book humanized the heck out of people I encounter in public, reminding me of &ldquo;This is Water&rdquo; by David Wallace. In it, he talks about viewing other people&rsquo;s actions through empathy and understanding, rather than defaulting to self-centered interpretations - something these stories achieve.</p>
<p>Mumbai isn&rsquo;t a replaceable part of these stories - its vibes are completely different from Bangalore. The stories capture Mumbai really well, with nice Bollywood cameos thrown in. The first story reminded me of when I lived in a single room on a terrace and how different life feels in a small space.</p>
<p>The stories feel strange since there&rsquo;s never a mention of mobile phones. Most would have a simpler resolution today with phones and internet. Most middle-class people probably don&rsquo;t even recognize this India, or the scenarios in it.</p>
<p>The stories don&rsquo;t aim for a dramatic ending. When each stories ends, you get the sense that the ending didn&rsquo;t really matter and it was the memories, experiences and a nice slice of life along the way.</p>
