<p>But I&rsquo;ve been extra creative with my coffee in 2025. I first started off with instant coffee (specifically <em>Continental Xtra</em> - which really has a kick), after tasting it at a cousin&rsquo;s place. Using instant coffee meant I could be lazier and skip the brewing process and get my coffee fix at pretty much any time. I make sure to buy the sachets instead of the larger 200gm pack (Its approx. 50% cheaper per gram).</p>
<p>Now to the more wild part. I&rsquo;ve been thinking of coffee as an entity and the milk as the delivery mechanism (or conduit). So I first experimented with making a coffee-style jelly. I kept the process and ingredients simple - instant coffee, gelatin, sugar, water; and voila - a delicious snack I hogged on like a pig. My second experiment was trying to add instant coffee to my coconut water during the summer and it tasted lovely and like something I never tasted before. This experiment really didn&rsquo;t last since coconuts prices shot up through the roof. My final stroke of genius is the yoghurt concoction snack. I mix honey, instant coffee powder with plain Epigamia yoghurt (topped with almonds).</p>
<p>Looking back it feels like these experiments are guided by the principle of max coffee flavour and simple delivery mechanisms and I love it.</p>
