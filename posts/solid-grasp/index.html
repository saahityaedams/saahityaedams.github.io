In college we were taught SOLID and GRASP principles which was more heuristics than principles<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> that was supposed to make our code better. I honestly don&#39;t know whether applying them helps as I never could remember it and I definitely wasn&#39;t thinking about applying it when I was writing code. But one thing that did stay with me from college that was taught and repeated dozens of times by a great professor was the idea of <strong>interface and implementation</strong>, which was beautifully taught in C++ with the interface being written in the header file and the implementation being written in the library source file. His point being <strong>interfaces</strong> are static and hard to change and must be designed well and carefully, in contast with <strong>implementation</strong>  being abstracted away from user and hence easy to change. A video he had asked us to look at that I recently rewatched after a year of being paid to write software makes a lot more sense now. The video expands on the above point + metions some other very usefull guidelines and is a must watch.  </p>

<p>Principles are fundamental truths that are found in maths and physics. Pretty sure there are no principles in software development only heuristics and guidelines.</p>
